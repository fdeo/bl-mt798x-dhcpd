/*
 * Where possible, we try to detect the presence of a platform-provided
 * secure memset, such as explicit_bzero(), that is safe against being optimized
 * out, and use that.
 *
 * For other platforms, we provide an implementation that aims not to be
 * optimized out by the compiler.
 *
 * This implementation for mbedtls_platform_zeroize() was inspired from Colin
 * Percival's blog article at:
 *
 * http://www.daemonology.net/blog/2014-09-04-how-to-zero-a-buffer.html
 *
 * It uses a volatile function pointer to the standard memset(). Because the
 * pointer is volatile the compiler expects it to change at
 * any time and will not optimize out the call that could potentially perform
 * other operations on the input buffer instead of just setting it to 0.
 * Nevertheless, as pointed out by davidtgoldblatt on Hacker News
 * (refer to http://www.daemonology.net/blog/2014-09-05-erratum.html for
 * details), optimizations of the following form are still possible:
 *
 * if (memset_func != memset)
 *     memset_func(buf, 0, len);
 *
 * Note that it is extremely difficult to guarantee that
 * the memset() call will not be optimized out by aggressive compilers
 * in a portable way. For this reason, Mbed TLS also provides the configuration
 * option MBEDTLS_PLATFORM_ZEROIZE_ALT, which allows users to configure
 * mbedtls_platform_zeroize() to use a suitable implementation for their
 * platform and needs.
