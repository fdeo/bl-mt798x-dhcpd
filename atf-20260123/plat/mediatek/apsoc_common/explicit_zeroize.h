/**
 * \brief       Securely zeroize a buffer
 *
 *              The function is meant to wipe the data contained in a buffer so
 *              that it can no longer be recovered even if the program memory
 *              is later compromised. Call this function on sensitive data
 *              stored on the stack before returning from a function, and on
 *              sensitive data stored on the heap before freeing the heap
 *              object.
 *
 *              It is extremely difficult to guarantee that calls to
 *              mbedtls_platform_zeroize() are not removed by aggressive
 *              compiler optimizations in a portable way. For this reason, Mbed
 *              TLS provides the configuration option
 *              MBEDTLS_PLATFORM_ZEROIZE_ALT, which allows users to configure
 *              mbedtls_platform_zeroize() to use a suitable implementation for
 *              their platform and needs
 *
 * \param buf   Buffer to be zeroized
 * \param len   Length of the buffer in bytes
 *
