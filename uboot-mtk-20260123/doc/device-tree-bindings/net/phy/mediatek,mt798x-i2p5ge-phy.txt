MediaTek MT7987/MT7988 built-in 2.5Gb Ethernet PHY

This document describes the device tree bindings for MediaTek MT7987/MT7988
built-in 2.5Gb Ethernet PHY.

Required properties:
- reg: The phy address

Optional properties:
- half-en: Boolean. The uplink XGMAC of this PHY doesn't support half duplex.
  As parallel detection is enabled in this PHY, we disabled the PHY's
  half-duplex capability by default. If you really want to connect to those
  devices supporting only 10M/half or 100M/half and don't care about duplex
  mismatch, use this option to force link up. Note that this PHY will still
  link up at full duplex.

- gbe-min-ipg-11-bytes-en: Boolean. If present, enables 11-byte minimum
  inter-packet gap for 1000Mbps link speed. When not present (by default),
  the PHY uses optimized IPG settings for better performance. This option is
  basically for those legacy 1G link partners which only accept higher IPG
  transfer.

- retrain-dis: Boolean. If present, this will block fast retrain and normal
  retrain at the same time. Not recommend to use this option unless you know
  what you're doing.

- auto-downshift-dis: Boolean. If present, disables the hardware
  auto-downshift feature. When not present (by default), the PHY will
  automatically downshift link speed when link quality is poor.

- pinctrl-names: Accepts "i2p5gbe-led" pinctrl for PHY status indicator

Notes:
- Firmware loading is required for proper operation. The driver expects
  firmware files to be available through weak symbol functions provided by
  boards.

Examples:
/* without option */
&eth1 {
	status = "okay";
	phy-mode = "xgmii";
	phy-handle = <&phy15>;

	phy15: ethernet-phy@15 {
		compatible = "ethernet-phy-ieee802.3-c45";
		reg = <15>;
		phy-mode = "xgmii";
	};
};

/* with options/pinctrl */
&eth1 {
	status = "okay";
	pinctrl-names = "i2p5gbe-led";
	pinctrl-0 = <&i2p5gbe_led0_pins>;
	phy-mode = "xgmii";
	phy-handle = <&phy15>;

	phy15: ethernet-phy@15 {
		compatible = "ethernet-phy-ieee802.3-c45";
		reg = <15>;
		half-en;
		gbe-min-ipg-11-bytes-en;
		auto-downshift-dis;
		phy-mode = "xgmii";
	};
};
